# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 
In this analysis I use python via Jupyter Notbooks to read, clean and analyze the data from PyBer, a ride sharing app. The two csv files contain data from Jan – May 2019 from over 120 cities. I specifically wanted to look the fare amounts and the number of drivers by city type. 


## Results

I took at the total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per diver from Jan 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019.

The above table shows that Rural cities had the smallest least amount of rides and the least amount of drivers, while Urban cities hold the greatest share of rides and have the largest number of drivers. It follows that the total fares are smallest in Rural cities and greatest in Urban cities. However, the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver are highest for Rural cities and lowest for Urban cities. For both Rural and Suburban cities, the Total Rides is greater than the Total drivers, but in Urban cities, the Total Rides is less than the Total Drivers, which means there are more drivers than needed. 

The below plot shows the total fares per week for each city type. It appears there was a spike in fares for each city type at the end of January.

## Summary 

Based on the above results, it is clear that Urban cities make up a majority of the rides and revenue. Since most of it’s revenue is generated in Urban cities, PyBer should focus on increasing and optimizing it’s business in Urban cities. In order to get better insights, it would be helpful to review a full year of data to see if there is higher demand in certain times of the year. I would also be helpful to look at times of the rides, specifically what times of day have the highest volumes of rides.
